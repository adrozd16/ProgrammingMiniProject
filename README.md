The project is based on a client-server connection. The server will start-up with a specific IP address and a specific port, and will be waiting for a connection request from the client.Where the client will have to input the same IP address and port as the server in order to connect to the server. Then the client will be able to insert words, characters or sentences in which it will be sent to the server later, and the server will translate it into ASCII and send it back to the client.
