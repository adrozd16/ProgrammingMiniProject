The project is based on a client-server connection. The server will start-up with a specific IP address and a specific port, and will be waiting for a connection request from the client.Where the client will have to input the same IP address and port as the server in order to connect to the server. Then the client will be able to insert words, characters or sentences in which it will be sent to the server later, and the server will translate it into ASCII and send it back to the client.

## Installing instructions

 * Download the project
 * Extract the .zip file
 * Run the server .exe file that can be found in (ProgrammingMiniProject-master\ProgrammingMiniProject-master\Server\x64\Debug\Chat.exe)
 * Run the client .exe file that can be found in (ProgrammingMiniProject-master\ProgrammingMiniProject-master\Client\x64\Debug\Client.exe)

_**Note**_ 
* It is important to run the server before the client, otherwise that will resault in en error when excuting the sofware.
* Remember to follow the instructions of the [tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/), there is one for each platform/compiler that SFML supports. And make sure to download the SFML in (C:\)
